 # Zombie Time

Welcome to Zombie Time! This is a web browser-based game developed for a week long [Mintbean](https://tinyurl.com/yhbpr783) hackathon.

Zombie Time was developed without any major frameworks, just vanilla JavaScript. The goal of the project was to see what kind of game we could build in a week without any kind of game engine to rely on.
